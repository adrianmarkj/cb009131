            <h3>LOLA'S BACKSTORY</h3>
            <p>Lola was rescued from an impoverished family in Yala that had taken her in as a cub; not knowing that she was in fact a leopard and not a kitten until she had grown a mnonth or two. Once the family had noticed their predicament Lola was placed in the care of Animal Control and was bound to be released to the Yala National Park, yet seeing as though she was more docile and seemed to prefer the company of humans as opposed to her own species she was taken in by the Dehiwala Zoo.</p>

                <p>Meeting a carnivorous animal for the first time can be daunting, especially when it's one as big and infamous as a jungle cat, but fear not! Lola is an extremely gentle and docile big cat! As long as you don't show aggressive behaviour towards her or excite her you will be fine. And of course our trained keeper Elizabeth will be with you every step of the way.</p>

                    <!-- CITATION 7 -->
                    <li>Leopards are often light-colored with black streaks on their coats. The design of these spots is identical to that of a rose, so they're called "rosettes." There are also black leopards, whose spots are difficult to see due to their thick coats.</li>
                    <li>Leopards are agile felines, capable of reaching speeds of up to 58 km/h. They're also extremely springy, capable of jumping 6 meters into the air â€“ the size of three adults standing head to toe.</li>
                    <li>Leopards are nocturnal; creatures who only come out at night to hunt for food. They spend most of their days sleeping in the forest or hiding in caves. </li>
